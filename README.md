# Character-Level GPT Model Creation from Scratch

## Overview

This repository provides the necessary resources and code for creating a Character-Level Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model from scratch. The goal is to build a language model capable of generating coherent and contextually relevant text at the character level.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/char-level-gpt.git
    ```
    
## Dataset
The included `Mahabharat.txt` dataset. It looks like:

```

every desire of his being fulfilled by thee, but not before Takshaka comes with speed.'
"Sauti continued, 'The king, being inclined to grant the Brahmana a boon, said 'Ask thou a boon.' The Hotri, however, being
rather displeased, said, 'Takshaka hath not come as yet into this sacrifice.'
"Janamejaya replied, 'Exert ye to the best of your might, so that this sacrifice of mine may attain completion, and Takshaka
also may soon come here. He is my enemy.'
"The Ritwiks replied, 'As the scriptures declare unto us, and as the fire also saith, O monarch, (it seems that) Takshaka is now
staying in the abode of Indra, afflicted with fear.'
